    **No credit card required** - Start building immediately!

**Status**: ‚úÖ Available (Free to Try)  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Use Case**: Basic automation, simple Q&A

### What is an Oracle?

Oracles are simple, single-purpose agents that provide fast question-answering capabilities. They interact directly with LLMs and respond to queries without external data connections. The output quality depends entirely on the LLM's training data.

This is a simple and fast question answering system that involves interaction with LLMs and responding to your queries. There is no connection to external data and quality of output directly depends on the quality of the LLMs used. This system can be very useful when you have fine-tuned models for specific tasks and give reliable outputs for your task but has limited external interaction and knowledge.

### What is a Genie?

Genies are multi-step reasoning agents that can interact with external systems through tools, memory, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). They use reasoning and action (ReAct) patterns to perform controlled actions on your behalf.

This is an agent system that involves interaction with LLMs and external systems like knowledge and tools. There is limited connection to external data and quality of output directly depends on the quality of the LLMs, knowledge, and tools used.

**Status**: üîí Commercial (Work in Progress)  
**Complexity**: Expert  
**Use Case**: Complex business workflows, research teams, e-commerce platforms

### What is a Superagent?

Superagents are multi-agent systems where a lead agent (Superagent) manages and coordinates other agents. They can spawn ephemeral subagents to perform tasks and work with other superagents. This tier involves high-level orchestration managed by AgentLines.

In the Superagents tier, there are multiple agents managing other agents or working together. In this, a lead agent called Superagent may spawn automated subagents to perform tasks and work with other superagents. This layer combines multiple agent architectures and topologies to orchestrate AI Agents. This involves higher levels of orchestration which will be managed by AgentLines. AgentLines are designed to manage multiple agents, superagents, and orchestras. Execution of AgentLines involves spawning ephemeral agents to perform tasks and needs high level of compute and resource management. This is the tier where high-level use of Kubernetes-style orchestration will happen and which involves using higher-level protocols than MCP may play the roles. The Agent2Agent Protocol is suitable in this tier.

### Key Characteristics

- ‚úÖ **Multi-agent coordination**: Lead agent management
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic subagent spawning**: On-demand agent creation
- ‚úÖ **AgentLines integration**: Advanced orchestration
- ‚úÖ **High-level protocols**: Beyond MCP and A2A

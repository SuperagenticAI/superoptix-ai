## üéØ What Are SuperOptiX Orchestras?

SuperOptiX orchestras coordinate multiple agents to accomplish complex goals through **sequential execution**. Unlike individual agents that work in isolation, orchestras enable agents to:

- **Collaborate sequentially** - Each agent builds upon the previous agent's output
- **Share context** - Results from one agent become input for the next
- **Maintain state** - Workspace directories store intermediate results
- **Execute workflows** - Complex multi-step processes with dependencies

### üîÑ Execution Strategy Support

| Tier | Execution Strategy | Parallel Tasks | Advanced Techniques |
|------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Oracles** | Sequential only | 1 | Basic orchestration |
| **Genies** | Sequential only | 1 | Basic orchestration |
| **Higher Tiers** | Parallel, Mixed, Hierarchical | Multiple | Kubernetes orchestration |

> **Note**: The current version (Oracles and Genies) supports **sequential execution only**. Advanced orchestration features are available in higher tiers.

### Workspace Management

Orchestras use **shared workspaces** to maintain state between agents:

```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestra_workspaces/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your_orchestra/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task_outputs/
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent1_output.txt
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent2_output.txt
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ agent3_output.txt
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ intermediate/
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data.json
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ artifacts/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ final_results/
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestra_output.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestras/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your_orchestra.yaml
```

## üöÄ Creating Your First Orchestra

### 1. Create an Orchestra

```bash
# Create an orchestra with existing agents
super orchestra create sdlc

# This automatically:
# - Detects existing agents in your project
# - Loads tasks from agent playbooks
# - Generates orchestra configuration
# - Creates workspace directory
```

### 2. Orchestra Configuration

The generated orchestra file (`sdlc_orchestra.yaml`):

```yaml
metadata:
  name: "Sdlc Orchestra"
  id: "sdlc"
  version: "1.0.0"
  kind: "basic"
  description: "An orchestra to accomplish a specific goal with flexible execution strategies."

orchestra:
  id: "sdlc"
  name: "Sdlc Orchestra"
  description: "An orchestra to accomplish a specific goal with flexible execution strategies."
  
  # Shared workspace for stateful collaboration
  workspace:
    type: local_fs 
    path: "./orchestra_workspaces/sdlc"
  
  # Execution configuration (sequential only for current version)
  execution:
    strategy: "sequential"
    max_parallel_tasks: 1
    task_timeout_seconds: 300
    retry_strategy: "exponential_backoff"
    enable_metrics: true
    enable_trace: true

# Agents participating in the orchestra
agents:
  - developer
  - devops_engineer
  - qa_engineer

# Task definitions with dependencies
tasks:
  - name: implement_feature
    agent: developer
    description: >
      Apply developer expertise to '{goal}'. Implement the feature based on the provided requirement
    priority: "medium"
    timeout_seconds: 600
    
  - name: configure_ci_pipeline
    agent: devops_engineer
    description: >
      Apply devops engineer expertise to '{goal}'. Configure a basic CI/CD pipeline based on the project requirements
    context: ["implement_feature"]  # Depends on previous task
    priority: "medium"
    timeout_seconds: 600
    
  - name: create_test_plan
    agent: qa_engineer
    description: >
      Apply qa engineer expertise to '{goal}'. Create a high-level test plan including test cases for the given feature
    context: ["configure_ci_pipeline"]  # Depends on previous task
    priority: "medium"
    timeout_seconds: 600
```

### 3. Run the Orchestra

```bash
# Run with a specific goal
super orchestra run sdlc --goal "Build a simple login feature for a web application"
```

---

## üé≠ How Orchestras Work

### Sequential Execution Flow

The orchestra runner executes tasks in sequence, passing results between agents:

1. **Task 1** executes with the initial goal
2. **Task 1** output becomes input for **Task 2**
3. **Task 2** output becomes input for **Task 3**
4. This continues until all tasks are completed
5. Final result is the output from the last task

### Task Execution Process

1. **Task Loading**: Orchestra runner loads task definitions from YAML
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Determines execution order based on `context` dependencies
3. **Agent Execution**: Each task runs its assigned agent with current input
4. **Result Passing**: Output from one task becomes input for the next
5. **Workspace Storage**: Intermediate results are saved to workspace directory

### Workspace Integration

The orchestra runner automatically manages workspace directories:

- **Creates workspace** when orchestra starts
- **Saves task outputs** to individual files
- **Maintains state** between task executions
- **Provides access** to intermediate results

---

## üîß Customizing Orchestras

### 1. Modify Task Descriptions

Make task descriptions more specific to your goal:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: implement_feature
    agent: developer
    description: >
      Implement a secure user authentication system with the following requirements:
      - User registration with email verification
      - Secure password hashing
      - JWT token-based authentication
      - Password reset functionality
      Use modern security best practices and provide clear documentation.
```

### 2. Adjust Task Priorities

Set task priorities to control execution order:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: critical_feature
    agent: developer
    priority: "high"
    description: "Implement critical security feature"
    
  - name: nice_to_have
    agent: developer
    priority: "low"
    description: "Add optional UI enhancements"
```

### 3. Configure Timeouts

Set appropriate timeouts for different task types:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: quick_validation
    agent: validator
    timeout_seconds: 60
    description: "Quick validation check"
    
  - name: complex_analysis
    agent: analyzer
    timeout_seconds: 1800  # 30 minutes
    description: "Complex data analysis"
```

## üìÅ Workspace Management

### Workspace Structure

Orchestra workspaces are automatically created and managed:

```
orchestra_workspaces/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your_orchestra/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task_outputs/           # Individual task results
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task1_output.txt
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task2_output.txt
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ task3_output.txt
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ intermediate/           # Shared data between tasks
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared_data.json
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ artifacts/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ final_results/          # Final orchestra output
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestra_output.txt
```

### Accessing Workspace Data

```python
# In your custom tools or agents
import json
from pathlib import Path

def read_workspace_data(orchestra_name: str, filename: str):
    """Read data from orchestra workspace."""
    workspace_path = Path(f"./orchestra_workspaces/{orchestra_name}")
    file_path = workspace_path / "intermediate" / filename
    
    if file_path.exists():
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            return json.load(f)
    return None

def write_workspace_data(orchestra_name: str, filename: str, data: dict):
    """Write data to orchestra workspace."""
    workspace_path = Path(f"./orchestra_workspaces/{orchestra_name}")
    intermediate_path = workspace_path / "intermediate"
    intermediate_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    
    file_path = intermediate_path / filename
    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
```

### Workspace Cleanup

```bash
# Clean up workspace after orchestra completion
rm -rf orchestra_workspaces/your_orchestra/

# Or keep for analysis
ls -la orchestra_workspaces/your_orchestra/
```

---

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Agent Preparation

Before running orchestras, ensure your agents are optimized:

```bash
# Compile all agents
super agent compile --all

# Evaluate baseline performance
super agent evaluate developer
super agent evaluate devops_engineer
super agent evaluate qa_engineer

# Optimize agents
super agent optimize developer
super agent optimize devops_engineer
super agent optimize qa_engineer

# Re-evaluate after optimization
super agent evaluate developer
super agent evaluate devops_engineer
super agent evaluate qa_engineer
```

### 2. Goal Definition

Write clear, specific goals for better orchestration results:

```bash
# Good: Specific and actionable
super orchestra run sdlc --goal "Build a secure user authentication system with JWT tokens, password hashing, and email verification"

# Avoid: Too vague
super orchestra run sdlc --goal "Make a login system"
```

### 3. Task Dependencies

Design logical task dependencies:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: gather_requirements
    agent: analyst
    description: "Gather and document requirements"
    
  - name: design_architecture
    agent: architect
    description: "Design system architecture"
    context: ["gather_requirements"]  # Depends on requirements
    
  - name: implement_system
    agent: developer
    description: "Implement the system"
    context: ["design_architecture"]  # Depends on architecture
```

### 4. Error Handling

Monitor orchestra execution and handle failures:

```bash
# Run with verbose output for debugging
super orchestra run sdlc --goal "your goal" --verbose

# Check workspace for partial results
ls -la orchestra_workspaces/sdlc/task_outputs/
```

---

## üîç Monitoring and Debugging

### Execution Monitoring

The orchestra runner provides detailed execution information:

```bash
super orchestra run sdlc --goal "your goal" --verbose
```

**Output includes:**
- Task execution order
- Execution times
- Success/failure status
- Workspace location
- Tier validation results

### Workspace Analysis

After orchestra completion, analyze the workspace:

```bash
# View task outputs
cat orchestra_workspaces/sdlc/task_outputs/implement_feature_output.txt
cat orchestra_workspaces/sdlc/task_outputs/configure_ci_pipeline_output.txt
cat orchestra_workspaces/sdlc/task_outputs/create_test_plan_output.txt

# View final results
cat orchestra_workspaces/sdlc/final_results/orchestra_output.txt
```

### Debugging Failed Orchestras

```bash
# Check which task failed
ls -la orchestra_workspaces/sdlc/task_outputs/

# View error logs
cat orchestra_workspaces/sdlc/task_outputs/failed_task_output.txt

# Re-run with dry-run to validate configuration
super orchestra run sdlc --goal "your goal" --dry-run
```

## üöÄ Advanced Techniques (Higher Tiers)

> **Note**: These features are available in higher tiers beyond Oracles and Genies.

### Parallel Execution

```yaml
execution:
  strategy: "parallel"
  max_parallel_tasks: 3
```

### Mixed Strategy

```yaml
execution:
  strategy: "mixed"
  task_groups:
    - name: "research_phase"
      tasks: ["gather_data", "analyze_requirements"]
      execution_strategy: "parallel"
    - name: "development_phase"
      tasks: ["implement", "test"]
      execution_strategy: "sequential"
```

### Kubernetes Orchestration

```yaml
orchestration_type: "kubernetes"
replicas: 3
resources:
  cpu: "1000m"
  memory: "2Gi"
```

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Create your first orchestra**: `super orchestra create my_orchestra`
2. **Customize the configuration**: Edit the generated YAML file
3. **Run with a specific goal**: `super orchestra run my_orchestra --goal "your goal"`
4. **Analyze results**: Check the workspace directory
5. **Optimize agents**: Improve individual agent performance
6. **Iterate and improve**: Refine orchestra configuration based on results

title: Agent Patterns
---

This guide explains AI Agents in SuperOptiX and the 5-tier evolutionary system that scales from simple automation to enterprise-grade AI operations.

---

## 🤖 What are AI Agents?

There is no standard definition of AI Agents yet in the industry, but we can define them in SuperOptiX as:

AI Agents are intelligent software systems that can:

- **Perceive** their environment through data and inputs
- **Reason** about tasks and goals using language models
- **Act** by executing tools, making decisions, or generating outputs
- **Learn** from interactions to improve performance over time

In SuperOptiX, agents are built using **DSPy (Declarative Self-Improving Python)** - a framework that optimizes prompts and reasoning chains automatically.

---

## 🎭 The 5-Tier Evolutionary System

SuperOptiX introduces a progressive architecture inspired by Nick Bostrom's **Superintelligence** book and Sam Altman's **5 tiers to AGI**. Each tier builds upon the previous one, adding complexity and capabilities.

**Note**: The industry is still figuring out agent communication protocols and patterns, so these will evolve with time as standards emerge.

## 🧙‍♂️ Oracles Tier - Entry Level

**Status**: ✅ Proprietary  
**Complexity**: Low  
**Best For**: Simple automation, Q&A systems

### What Oracles Can Do

Oracles are single-purpose agents that provide fast question-answering capabilities. They interact directly with language models and respond to queries without external connections.

**Note**: Oracles are designed for demos and prototypes. Their output is not configured for chaining in multi-agentic systems or orchestras, and they are not optimized to work with parallel configurations.

**Key Capabilities:**

- 🧩 **Single-step reasoning** — Direct question-to-answer mapping
- 📝 **Template-based responses** — Consistent output formats
- ⚡ **Built-in optimization** — DSPy-powered prompt tuning
- 🛡️ **Simple validations** — Basic output verification
- 🤖 **Any LLM support** — Works with any language model

### Example Use Cases

```yaml
# FAQ Bot
# In the Agent Playbook we can use this as:
apiVersion: agent/v1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: faq-bot
  tier: oracle
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: answer_faq
      template: "Answer this FAQ: {question}"
```

```yaml
# Data Formatter
# In the Agent Playbook we can use this as:
apiVersion: agent/v1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: data-formatter
  tier: oracle
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: format_data
      template: "Format this data as JSON: {input}"
```

**Perfect for:** Simple Q&A, data formatting, basic automation, prototyping

## 🧞‍♂️ Genies Tier - Intermediate

**Status**: ✅ Proprietary  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Best For**: Customer service, content creation, complex problem-solving

### What Genies Can Do

Genies are multi-step reasoning agents that can interact with external systems through tools, memory, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). They use reasoning and action (ReAct) patterns.

**Note**: Genies are designed for demos and prototypes. Their output is not configured for chaining in multi-agentic systems or orchestras, and they are not optimized to work with parallel configurations.

**Key Capabilities:**

- 🧠 **Multi-step reasoning** — Chain-of-thought problem solving
- 🛠️ **Dynamic tool selection** — Intelligent tool usage
- 🗂️ **Memory integration** — Learning from interactions
- 📚 **RAG support** — Knowledge retrieval from vector databases
- 📞 **Function calling** — Advanced LLM capabilities

### Example Use Cases

```yaml
